To commemorate this historic event in human spaceflight and NASA’s history, Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum will present “Spirit of Apollo,” a program celebrating the milestone Apollo 8 mission, which brought humanity together and pushed the limits of exploration.   The event took place at 8 p.m. EST, Tuesday, Dec. 11, at Washington National Cathedral."
